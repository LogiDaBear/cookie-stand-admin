# cookie-stand-admin
### Author: Logan Reese


## Feature Tasks and Requirements
Your job is to create a Cookie Stand Admin app using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and style using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- The spec for lab is screen shot of Cookie Stand Admin Version 1
pages/Index.js should…
```
    - Have <Head> component with page title set to Cookie Stand Admin
    - Have a <header> component that matches spec.
    - Have a <main> component containing <form> and    a placeholder component showing JSON string of last created Cookie Stand.
    - Have a <footer> component that matches spec.
    - Style app using TailwindCSS utility classes.
```
## Implementing
Follow [Install Tailwind CSS with Next.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) steps
- NOTE: There are a couple small differences between Tailwind’s directions and the way we’ll be running things:
- name your app cookie-stand-admin instead of my-project
- use --javascript flag instead of --typescript
- E.g. npx create-next-app@latest cookie-stand-admin --javascript --eslint
- choose no or the default for remaining options.

Strip out unused files
Won’t break if they get left in, but a good practice to remove stuff you’re not using.
